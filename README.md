# Personal-Css-framework
My personal css framework created with SCSS, with the style that I like and the only attributes that I need.

Fell free to add and change.

How to use:
copy the 'shadow.min.css' and 'shadow.min.js' in the folder of your project.


sass command -> sass --watch scss/shadow.min.scss:css/shadow.min.css --style compressed
